Bundletool is a command-line tool to manipulate and build Android App Bundles - https://g.co/androidappbundle
We use it to build the final android bundle, after building each bundle module

Acquired from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.android.tools.build/bundletool
Modified jar to remove the shadow/bundletool/com/android/tools/r8 package,
which appears to be an obfuscated version of Proguard which Buck doesn't use.
This package contains numerous class files with the same name but different
capitalization, which causes Buck to fail with an internal error on Windows. 

Release Number: 0.10.3
