A <code>d_test()</code> rule is used to define a set of D source
files that contain tests to run via D's unittest support. The source code of the test
must provide a main() function.

  {param name: 'labels' /}

  {param desc}
  A list of labels to be applied to these tests. These labels are
  arbitrary text strings and have no meaning within buck itself. They
  can, however, have meaning for you as a test author
  (e.g., <code>smoke</code> or <code>fast</code>). A label can be
  used to filter or include a specific <code>d_test()</code> rule
  when executing <a href="{ROOT}command/test.html"><code>buck
  test</code></a>.
