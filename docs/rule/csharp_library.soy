<p>
  A csharp_library() rule builds a .Net library from the supplied set of C# source files
  and dependencies by invoking csc.

{call buck.name_arg /}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'dll_name' /}
  {param default: 'The name of the target appended with .dll' /}
  {param desc}
  The output name of the dll. This allows you to specify the name of
  the dll exactly. When this is not set, the dll will be named after
  the short name of the target.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'srcs' /}
  {param desc}
  The collection of source files to compile.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'resources' /}
  {param desc}
  Resources that should be embedded within the built DLL. The format
  is the name of the resource once mapped into the DLL as the key, and
  the value being the resource that should be merged. This allows
  non-unique keys to be identified quickly.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'framework_ver' /}
  {param desc}
  The version of the .Net framework that this library targets. This is
  one of 'net35', 'net40', 'net45' and 'net46'.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'deps' /}
  {param default: [] /}
  {param desc}
  The set of targets or system-provided assemblies to rely on. Any
  values that are targets must be either csharp_library or <a
  href="{ROOT}rule/prebuilt_dotnet_library.html"><code>prebuilt_dotnet_library</code></a>
  {sp} instances.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}

  {param desc}
    The set of additional compiler flags to pass to the compiler.
