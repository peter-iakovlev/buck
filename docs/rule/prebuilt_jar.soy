      A rule that is used to identify a JAR file that is checked into the
      project as a precompiled binary.

{param status: 'FROZEN' /}
{param overview}
A <code>prebuilt_jar()</code> rule is used to identify a JAR file that
is checked into our repository as a precompiled binary rather than one
that is built from source by Buck. Frequently, these are used to
reference third-party JAR files (such as </code>junit.jar</code>) and
are used as dependencies of <a
href="java_library.html"><code>java_library()</code></a> rules.

{param args}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'binary_jar' /}
  {param desc}
  Path to the pre-built JAR file.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'source_jar' /}
  {param default : 'None' /}
  {param desc}
  Path to a JAR file that contains the <code>.java</code> files to create
  the <code>.class</code> in the <code>binary_jar</code>. This is frequently
  provided for debugging purposes.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'javadoc_url' /}
  {param default : 'None' /}
  {param desc}
  URL to the Javadoc for the <code>.class</code> files in the
  {sp}<code>binary_jar</code>.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'deps' /}
  {param default : '[]' /}
  {param desc}
  Rules that must be built before this rule. Because the
  {sp}<code>binary_jar</code> is already built, there should be nothing to
  build, so this should be empty.
