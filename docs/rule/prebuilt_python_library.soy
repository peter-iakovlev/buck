      A prebuilt_python_library() rule is used to include binary python packages (i.e. eggs).

{call buck.rule}
{param status: 'UNFROZEN' /}
{param overview}
A <code>prebuilt_python_library()</code> rule is used to include prebuilt python packages into the output of a
top-level {call buck.python_binary /} or {call buck.python_test /} rule.

To create an egg for a package, run <code>python setup.py bdist_egg</code> in the package source distribution.

{param args}

{call buck.name_arg /}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'binary_src' /}
  {param desc}
  The path to the <code>.egg</code> to use. Note: <code>.egg</code> files have a very particular naming convention
  that must be followed - otherwise pex will not find the dependency properly at runtime!
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'deps' /}
  {param default : '[]' /}
  {param desc}
  Other <code>prebuilt_python_library()</code> rules which this library depends on. These may also
  be <code>python_library</code> rules if you want to depend on a source-based copy of the library.
