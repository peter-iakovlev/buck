{param overview}
An <code>core_data_model()</code> rule contains models for Apple's Core Data framework. This rule does not have any output on its own and can be built only as a dependency
(either direct or transitive) of an <a href="{ROOT}rule/apple_bundle.html">
<code>apple_bundle()</code> rule</a>, in which case all <code>core_data_model()</code> rules
that the bundle rule depends on are merged and placed into the final output bundle together.
