      A rule that is used to bundle Apple asset catalogs.

{param status: 'UNFROZEN' /}
{param overview}
An <code>apple_asset_catalog()</code> rule contains resources stored in Apple asset catalog
directories. This rule does not have any output on its own and can be built only as a dependency
(either direct or transitive) of an <a href="{ROOT}rule/apple_bundle.html">
<code>apple_bundle()</code> rule</a>, in which case all <code>apple_asset_catalog()</code> rules
that the bundle rule depends on are merged and placed into the final output bundle together.
{/param}

{param args}

{call buck.name_arg /}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'dirs' /}
  {param default : '[]' /}
  {param desc}
  Set of paths of Apple asset catalogs contained by this rule. All paths have to end with the <code>
  .xcassets</code> extension and be compatible with the asset catalog format used by Xcode.
  {/param}
{/call}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'app_icon' /}
  {param default: 'None' /}
  {param desc}
  An optional reference to a <code>.appiconset</code> containing a image set representing an
  application icon.  (The extension itself should not be included.)  This parameter
  may be specified at most once in a given <code>apple_bundle</code>'s transitive dependencies.
  {/param}

{call buck.arg}
  {param name: 'launch_image' /}
  {param default: 'None' /}
  {param desc}
  An optional reference to a <code>.launchimage</code> containing a image set representing an
  application launch image.  (The extension itself should not be included.)  This parameter
  may be specified at most once in a given <code>apple_bundle</code>'s transitive dependencies.
